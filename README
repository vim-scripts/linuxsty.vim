This plugin is meant to help you respecting the Linux kernel coding style, described at:
http://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/CodingStyle

It will automatically apply known rules to kernel related files, such as .c, .h, Kconfig and patch files.
The main rules are about indentation and syntax error highlighting (like exceeding 80 chars).

If you have any comments, fixes or requests, feel free to contact me or send me a patch.
The development also takes place at https://github.com/vivien/vim-linux-coding-style.
